# Welcome to Copilot

## **Helping Organizations Thrive Through Meaningful Conversations**

Everyone Needs A Copilot. This isn't just the name of the company but a statement of fact. In today's world of constant change and uncertainty, having someone to help you navigate the turbulence of the shifting technology landscape and the ever-evolving customer and employee expectations is essential to success.

At the same time, it is rare to have an advisor who isn't incentivized to establish a foothold within your organization to expand their presence and influence. Everyone Needs A Copilot was born with the idea that the best advice is one with no strings attached or no hidden agenda to 'land and expand.'

That is our promise. We're not looking for recurring revenue. Which is absolutely a poor business decision. And it may mean that we're not in business for long. But we're here now and here to serve you and help your organization thrive.

Everyone Needs A Copilot. If you don't have one, we'd love to be yours.
